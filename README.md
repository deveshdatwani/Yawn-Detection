# Yawn Detection 

### Introduction

Yawn can be an indicator of fatigue. An application that detects when a person yawns could be deployed at various platforms.

### Theory

This application uses the dlib library to detect shapes. The shape predictor algorithm implemented in the dlib library comes from Kazemi and Sullivanâ€™s 2014 CVPR paper, One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees.

The shape predictor 68 face landmarks is a pretained face detector that detects 68 landmarks on a face. They are numbered as shown below.

To detect if a person is yawning or not, we need to determine if the upper and lower lips are seperated by decent amount of pixels for a sufficient amount of time. A yawn generally lasts 2-3 seconds. This could give us the different between yawns and yelling/talking.

The following code block shows the most important part of tha application. Rest everything is pretty standard.
