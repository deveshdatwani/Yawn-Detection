# Yawn Detection 

### Introduction

Yawn can be an indicator of high fatigue levels. An application that detects if a person is yawning could be deployed at various platforms.

### Theory

This Python program uses the dlib library to detect shapes. The shape predictor algorithm implemented in the dlib library comes from Kazemi and Sullivanâ€™s 2014 CVPR paper, One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees. Feel free to read more about it.

The shape predictor 68 face landmarks is a pretained face detector that detects 68 landmarks on a face. They are numbered as shown below.

To detect if a person is yawning or not, we need to determine if the upper and lower lips are seperated by decent amount of pixels for a sufficient amount of time. A yawn generally lasts 2-3 seconds. This could give us the different between yawns and yelling/talking. We can further train a Neural Network with labelled images. But this project doesn't go into that.

The following code block shows the most important part of tha application. Rest everything is pretty standard.

### Installation and Launch (Linux)

Clone the git repository using the following command 

```
git clone https://github.com/deveshdatwani/Yawn-Detection.git
```

Run the yawn_detection.py script using

``` 
python3 Yawn_Detect.py
```
