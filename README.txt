## Yawn Detection 

### Introduction

Traffic Safety studies conclude that as much as 10 percent of the total car crashes in the world were due to Fatigue or Drowsiness.

A yawn can indicate high levels of fatigue.

This application, written in Python, deploys the OpenCV and DLIB libraries to detect if a human is yawning. The subject can then be alerted by sounding an alarm.
